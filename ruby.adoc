# Programming Ruby

## Instalation

### Linux

TIP: Do not use prepackaged Ruby on Linux distributions.

On Linux use https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv[`rbenv`] package manager with the
https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build[`ruby-build`] extension to install Ruby.

### Windows

For windows there is an installer https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/[Ruby Installer]
simplifies the installation to the "windows standard approach".

### macOS

The simplest way to install Ruby on macOS is to use `homebrew` package manager

[source,bash]
----
$ brew install ruby
----

in case there is a need to have multiple installations
https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv[`rbenv`]
is a good tool to use. Another popular tool is called `rvm` but nowadays they do too
much magic and we recommend using `rbenv` instead.

## Running Ruby

TIP: Usually you put `ruby` and relates command on PATH so you do not need to always
specify the whole path to the executable. With tools like `rbenv` this is done for you.

[source,bash]
----
$ ruby -v
----

runs Ruby and prints it's version. Simplest way to verify that your instalation
works as expected.

[source,bash]
----
$ ruby script.rb
----

interprets the script.rb. However instead of running the script explicitly, you can
add the shebang line to your script

[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
----

and make it executable (`chmox +x script.rb`) and run it simply as `./script.rb`.

### Interactive Ruby

Ruby comes with an interactive interpreter called `irb` it allows you to enter commands
and see results instantly.

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
----

## About Ruby

Ruby a programming language with following aspects

### Interpreted

The Ruby code is interpreted when the script is load, there is no compile phase.

### Fully Object oriented

In Ruby everything is an object and you send messages to those objects.

### Everything is an expression

Everything command in Ruby has a return value.

### Atomic memory management

### Strongly typed

There are some implicit conversions (e.g. every object has `to_s` method to provide
string representation) but in most cases in case you try to operate on different types
Ruby will complain, unless such operation is explicitly provided.

[source]
----
irb(main):001:0> 5 + "a"
TypeError: String can't be coerced into Fixnum
	from (irb):1:in `+'
	from (irb):1
----

### Dynamically typed

The type of variable is defined by value that is assigned to that variable. There is
no explicitly type information in the code.

[source]
----
a = "string"
----

## Conventions

* class names are CamelCase
* file names reflect class names in snake_case format
* method names are snake_case
* constants are UPPER_CASE
* indent by 2 spaces
* methods returning boolean values end with `?`
* methods mutating state end with `!`

## Basic syntax

Basic and most explicit syntax looks like

[source]
----
puts("hello world!");
----

However the parenthesis are optional in case the only one interpretation of the
expression

[source]
----
puts "hello world!";
----

and semicolons are optional as well

[source]
----
puts "hello world!"
----

String use either quotation marks `"` or apostrophes `'`. Apostrophes does not provide
string substitution as quotations marks do.

[source]
----
irb(main):001:0> a = 'Hello'
=> "Hello"
irb(main):002:0> b = "#{a} world"
=> "Hello world"
irb(main):003:0> b = '#{a} world'
=> "\#{a} world"
----

### Operator priority

### Special characters in method names

Ruby allows usage of special characted in method names. The standard is to use

* the question mark `?` for methods that return boolean value
* the exclamation mark `!` for methods that mutate the object

[source]
----
1.even?                 # => false
"ruby".upcase.reverse   # => 'YBUR'
"ruby".size.even?       # => true
----

### Comments

In the code above the single line comment is used. It starts with hash `#` and follows
to the end of the line. In case of commenting multiple lines, it is customary to
comment every line with single line comment.

[source]
----
# you should
# do this
# to comment
# multiple lines
----

## Data types

As mentioned above in Ruby everything is an object, including arrays or numbers.
However there are special syntax shorthands to create instances of special classes.

### Strings

As mentioned above String are create by quoting the charachters

[source]
----
a = "string"
b = 'string'
----

### Numbers

Ruby has two basic number classes `Fixnum` and `Float`.

[source]
----
irb(main):001:0> a = 1
=> 1
irb(main):002:0> a.class
=> Fixnum
irb(main):003:0> b = 1.1
=> 1.1
irb(main):004:0> b.class
=> Float
----

### Empty value

Special value that represents "nothing" is `nil`.

[source]
----
irb(main):001:0> a = nil
=> nil
----

In a boolean expression, `nil` is considered false, i.e. it's only of two possible
values that are not considered true.

### Booleans

As usual there is either `true` or `false`.

[source]
----
irb(main):001:0> a = true
=> true
irb(main):002:0> b = false
=> false
irb(main):003:0> a && b
=> false
irb(main):004:0> a || b
=> true
----

### Arrays

Arrays is an ordered sequence of values. There are no restrictions on what types can
be in a single array.

[source]
----
irb(main):001:0> ["a", 1, true]
=> ["a", 1, true]
----

### Hashes

Hash is a structure that maps key to a value.

[source]
----
irb(main):001:0> {"a" => true, "b": false}
=> {"a"=>true, :b=>false}
----

There are two approaches how to write the mapping, either `rocket` style

[source]
----
key => value
----

or `json` style

[source]
----
key: value
----

You can use both syntaxes, however with the `json` style the value is converted
to `symbol`, so in case you need to use `String` or some other type, or get the name
of the key from a variable, you need to use the `rocket` style. Several well-known
coding guidelines recommend (and enforce) using `rockets` everywhere.

### Symbols

Symbol is a keyword. It always maps to the same object instance

[source]
----
irb(main):001:0> a = "a"
=> "a"
irb(main):002:0> b = "a"
=> "a"
irb(main):003:0> a.object_id
=> 70224766839340
irb(main):004:0> b.object_id
=> 70224750415480
irb(main):005:0> a = :a
=> :a
irb(main):006:0> b = :a
=> :a
irb(main):007:0> a.object_id
=> 722268
irb(main):008:0> b.object_id
=> 722268
----

## Objects and methods

Methods are called by using the `.`. Operators are actually methods.

[source]
----
irb(main):001:0> 3 + 3
=> 6
irb(main):002:0> 3.+(3)
=> 6
irb(main):003:0> [1,2][0]
=> 1
irb(main):004:0> [1,2].[](0)
=> 1
----

## Variables

Ruby has global variables prefixed by `$`.

[source,ruby]
----
$stdout
----

Classes and object can use class variables, though there are no used very much.

[source,ruby]
----
@@class_variables = 1
----

Objects have instance variables.

[source,ruby]
----
@instance_variable = 1
----

Local variables have no prefix.

[source,ruby]
----
local_variable = 1
----

And finally constants are all upper case.

[source,ruby]
----
CONSTANT = 1
----

## Conditions

Everything is considered `true` except `false` and `nil`.

[source,ruby]
----
a = nil
b = ""

if a
  "we do not get in here"
elsif b
  "we got here"
else
  "we did not get here"
end
----

Ruby has negative variant to `if` called `unless`. Essentially `unless bool_expr` is
equivalent to `if !(bool_expr)`. It is used the same way as normal `if`.

[source,ruby]
----
a = nil
b = ""

unless a
  "we do get in here"
elsif b
  "we did not get here"
else
  "we did not get here"
end
----

Ruby has inline method of using conditionals called modifier statements.

[source,ruby]
----
puts "Hello" if true
puts "Hello" unless false
----

Ternary operator is available as well.

[source,ruby]
----
experssion ? 'was evaluated true' : 'was evaluated false'
----

Another way to do conditions is to use `case` statement.

[source,ruby]
----
case input
  when 'q', 'e'
    quit
  when 'f'
    format
  else
    help
end
----

`Case` statement can as well check on variable class.

[source,ruby]
----
case var
  when String
    "it's string"
  when Class
    "it's class"
  when Number
    "it's number"
end
----

Another way to use `case` statement is to use it as `if` and `elsif`.

[source,ruby]
----
case
  when a == "a"
    "a equals a"
  when b == "b"
    "b equals b"
end
----

## Logical operators

There are basic logical expressions

* and `&&`
* or `||`
* not `!`

as well `&&` can be replaced with `and`, `||` can be replaced with `or` and `!` can
be replaced with `not`.

There are basic comparison operators

* equal `==`
* not equal `!=`
* lesser then `<`
* greater then `>`
* lesser then or equal `>=`
* greater then or equal `<=`
* regular expersion match `=~`

## Regular expressions

Regular expressions are enclosed with `/`. The simplest way is to use the regexp
operator.

[source,ruby]
----
string = 'localhost:2000'
string =~ /.*:.+/     # 0
string =~ /(.)*:(.)+/ # sets $1 a $2
----

as well there is a `match` method on string.

[source,ruby]
----
data = string.match(/^(.):(\d+)$/)
data[1] # => localhost
data[2] # => 2000
----

## Loops

`while` repeats as long as the condition is true.

[source,ruby]
----
while a < b
  a += 1
end
----

To go through the body of the loop at least once

[source,ruby]
----
begin
  a += 1
end while a < b
----

There is as well inline way to write the loop

[source,ruby]
----
a += 1 while a < b
----

And finally the negative counterpart `until`

[source,ruby]
----
until a > b
  a += 1
end
----

## Methods

Methods in Ruby always return some value. If it is not explicitly returned using the
`return` keyword, the return value is the value of the last expression in the method.
Return as usual returns from method and ends the execution of the method.

[source,ruby]
----
# Simple method with two arguments
def mth(a, b)
end

# Method with default value for 2nd argument
def mth(a, b=1)
end

# Method accepting any number of arguments, available as Array args
def mth(*args)
end

# Method requiring at least two arguments
def mth(a, b, *args)
end
----

## Reusing code from other files

The `require` method loads code from another file. Ruby keeps track of required files
and skips loading files that would be loaded 2nd time. Files are looked up using Ruby's
load path, which is represented using an array in `$LOAD_PATH`. The `load` method does
not keep track of loaded files.

## Blocks

Blocks have many uses-cases. One of the use cases is the replacement for `for` cycles
another use case is `anonnymous functions`. Block are not executed when defined, but
needs to be called using the `call` method (though the calling of `call` method is
most of the times hidden from the develop as in the example below).

Arrays have method called `each` that accepts block and calls the block for every
single element in the array.

[source,ruby]
----
arr = [1,2,3,4]
arr.each do |el|
  puts el
end
----

will print all four values to the standard output. Block have another possibility

[source,ruby]
----
arr = [1,2,3,4]
arr.each { |el| puts el }
----

this variant is usually used for single-line blocks.

Block see their own scope plus can access scope in which were defined.

[source,ruby]
----
sum = 0
arr = [1,2,3,4]
arr.each { |el| sum += el }
----

Any method can accept a block and call it

[source]
----
def mth
  return nil unless block_given?
  yield
end
----

This method will return nil if no block was given or will call the block without any
argument and the return value of the block will be return from the method.

Method may also accept blocks as a named argument which is prefixed by `&`.

[source,ruby]
----
def mth(num,&block)
  block.call(num)
end
----

this method will call block saved in the variable `block` and will pass one argument
which is the argument passed to the method itself.

## Objects

In Ruby everything is an object. Object is an instance of some class. Even every class
is an instance of class that inherits from Class. Object can have methods

[source,ruby]
----
class Hello
  def say
    "Hello, world!"
  end
end

puts Hello.new.say
----

and instance variables

[source,ruby]
----
class Hello
  def initialize(msg=nil)
    @msg = msg
  end

  def say
    @msg
  end
end

puts Hello.new("Hello, world!").say
----

To make your instance variables accessible from outside, you define them as attributes.
Attributes can be either read-only, write-only or both.

[source,ruby]
----
class Hello
  attr_reader :one       # allows reading by using the .one method
  attr_writer :two       # allows writing by using the .two = "xy" method
  attr_accessor :three   # allows both, reading and writing
end
----

## Inheritance

Ruby allows object inheritance. All methods including constructor are inherited. Methods
can be overridden by children. `super` is then used to call the original method.

[source,ruby]
----
class A
  def a
    "hello"
  end
end

puts A.new.a # => hello

class B < A
end

puts B.new.a # => hello

class C < A
  def a
    super + " world"
  end
end

puts C.new.a # => hello world
----

## Class methods and attributes

As known from other language, except in Ruby class variables are not used because of
some pitfalls in their inheritance.

[source,ruby]
----
class A
  def self.a
    "hello"
  end
end

puts A.a # => hello
----

## Monkey patching

Ruby allows you to `open` already defined classes and change their definition including
replacement of methods. However `with great power comes great responsibility`.

[source]
----
"hello".upcase # => HELLO

class String
  def upcase
    "*" * self.size
  end
end

"hello".upcase # => *****
----

## Modules

Modules are a way to organize your classes in a similar fashion to namespaces. Classes
can be included into modules or into other classes.

[source]
----
class A
  class B
  end
end

module Some
  class Thing
  end
end
----

Module are however used as well as mixins. When module is included into class all
methods defined for that module are available in the class as instance methods.

[source]
----
module Helper
  def something
  end
end

class A
  include Helper
end

A.new.something
----

and when used with `extend` the mehtods are included as class methods

[source]
----
module Helper
  def something
  end
end

class A
  extend Helper
end

A.something
----

Ruby has only single inheritance, mixins allow to get around this and provide a
way to get some kind of multiple inheritance.

## Method access

By default methods are `public`, explicitly methods can be made `protected` or `private`.

[source]
----
class A
  def public_method
  end

  protected

  def protected_method
  end

  private

  def private_method
  end
end
----

The `send` method allows bypassing the privacy of a method. By itself it allows
dynamically calling method.

[source]
----
class A
  def public_method
  end

  private

  def private_method
  end
end

A.new.send(:private_method)
----

## Duck typing

Ruby encourages to react based on behaviour rather then on identity.

[source,ruby]
----
class Hunter
  def shoot(animal)
    bang! if animal.class == Duck
  end
end
----

in this case the code check if it's a duck and shoots it, however

[source,ruby]
----
class Hunter
  def shoot(animal)
    animal.respond_to?(:quack) && bang!
  end
end
----

in this case we care if the animal qucks and the it's shot.

## Method_missing

Every object can define special `methhod_missing` method that is called whenever
there is a call to undefined method on that object.

[source,ruby]
----
class A
  def method_missing(name, *args, &block)
    puts "method #{name} called with args #{args.inspect}"
  end
end

A.new.something("a") # => method something called with args ["a"]
----

## Metaprogramming

Metaprogramming allows you to dynamically work with your program through Ruby code.
Most of the times people use this technique for building DSL (domain specific languages)
in Ruby.

One of the most important aspects of metaprogramming is to understand what an eigenclass
(singleton class) is.

Let's start with something special. In Ruby it's possible to define per object methods.

[source,ruby]
----
string = "hello"

def string.star
  "*" * self.size
end

string.star # => *****

"world".star # => NoMethodError: undefined method `star' for "world":String
----

OK, now the question is, where is the method stored? It can not be on the String class
as it's available only to the specific instance. And instances do not store methods,
only classes do. And the answer is our eigenclass. The closes method to any object is
not it's class but it's eigenclass. So, whenever you define per-object behaviour the
method is stored in it's eigenclass.

## Exceptions

Exceptions represnt a special state in the execution in a program. When an exception
is raised, it will bubling thorugh the stack until is caught.

Exceptions are raised using the `raise` keyword

[source]
----
raise Exception.new("Hello")
----

On the other hand when an exception needs to be caught, code block is extended with
`rescue` statement that is called when an exception is caught and optionally `ensure`
that is called after both exceptional and non-exceptional state.

[source]
----
begin
  raise Exception.new
rescue => e
  puts e.message
ensure
  puts "always"
end
----
